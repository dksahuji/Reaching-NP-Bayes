# This is a code repository for learning and understanding Nonparametric Bayes. I will try to write a tutorial for wider audience too after implementing this.
To start we will:
1. Simulate polya urn scheme, chinese restraunt process, stick breaking process.
2. Implement GMM by gibbs sampling.
3. Implement CRPbased clustering by gibbs sampling.
